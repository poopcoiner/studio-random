## Challenge

Create a cohesive personal brand and web presence for a rising crypto influencer who needed to consolidate their content, trading insights, and community interactions into a single destination.

## Solution

We developed a comprehensive brand identity starting with the name "JustSteve" which embodied the client's straightforward, no-nonsense approach to crypto education. 

Our work included:
- Complete naming strategy and brand identity development
- Design system with logo variants, typography, and motion guidelines
- Custom website with dynamic content integration from multiple platforms
- Interactive elements for community engagement and newsletter signups
- Analytics integration to track content performance

The website serves as both portfolio and content hub, with a minimalist aesthetic that prioritizes readability and content discovery while maintaining the distinctive voice that made Steve popular.

## Results

- **43% increase** in newsletter signups after site launch
- **5-minute average** session duration (industry avg: 1.5 min)
- **72% reduction** in bounce rate compared to previous platform
- Featured in "Top Crypto Personalities to Follow" by CoinDesk
