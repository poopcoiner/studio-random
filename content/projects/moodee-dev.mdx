## Challenge

Design and implement a novel cryptocurrency with a unique mechanism: a dynamic tax rate that adjusts based on community sentiment, creating a self-balancing ecosystem that rewards long-term holders and penalizes emotional trading.

## Solution

We created Moodee, a token with dynamic taxation that responds to market sentiment. The system uses various inputs including trading volume, holder behavior, and social sentiment to determine daily tax rates, all visualized through an intuitive dashboard.

Our contribution included:
- User experience design for the Moodee dashboard and wallet interface
- Website design and development with interactive tax rate visualization
- Smart contract architecture for the sentiment-driven tax mechanism
- Data visualization of community sentiment metrics
- Technical documentation and educational resources

The interface relies heavily on emotional visual cues, with color gradients and animations that reflect the current community "mood" while keeping technical metrics accessible for advanced users.

## Results

- **27,000+** wallet holders within 2 months
- **15% reduction** in panic-selling during market volatility
- **$4.8M** market cap achieved at peak
- **93%** positive sentiment in community surveys
