## Challenge

Create a Telegram bot that simplifies crypto trading for everyday users while providing advanced functionality for power traders—all with an intuitive UI that works within Telegram's constraints.

## Solution

We designed a conversation-based UI that makes complex trading operations accessible through simple commands. The bot includes real-time market data visualization, wallet tracking, and one-click trading capabilities, all built as a native Telegram experience.

Our role encompassed both the UI/UX design and full bot development, including:
- Custom command parser for natural language trading instructions
- Real-time market data integration with price alerts
- Wallet connection and transaction signing within Telegram
- Seamless onboarding flow with progressive complexity

## Results

- **18,000+ wallets** connected in the first week of launch
- **$5.2M** trading volume through the bot in first month
- **92%** user retention after 30 days
- Integration with 6 major DEXs and CEXs
