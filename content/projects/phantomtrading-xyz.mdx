## Challenge

Develop an automated trading platform that allows retail investors to mirror the strategies of professional traders without requiring deep technical knowledge or constant monitoring of market conditions.

## Solution

We built PhantomTrading.xyz as a comprehensive trading suite with an intuitive UI that makes algorithmic trading accessible. The platform connects to professional traders' APIs and translates their actions into executable strategies for retail investors.

Our work encompassed:
- Complete product strategy from concept to launch roadmap
- User interface design with intuitive strategy selection and monitoring
- Complex backend systems for API integration, strategy parsing, and execution
- Risk management tools with customizable parameters
- Real-time performance analytics and reporting

The interface emphasizes clarity through data visualization, making complex trading strategies understandable at a glance while providing depth for those who want to dig deeper.

## Results

- **$12M** in assets under management within 3 months
- **22.7%** average outperformance vs. market benchmarks
- **3,500+** active users in beta phase
- **53 sec** average time to strategy activation for new users
