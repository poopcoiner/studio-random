## Challenge

Create a revolutionary platform that transforms the relationship between musicians and fans by allowing supporters to invest in artists' careers, receiving a share of streaming royalties and other revenue streams through tokenization.

## Solution

We designed a comprehensive brand system and user experience for Popcoinz.io that feels familiar to music fans while introducing Web3 concepts in an accessible way. The platform allows fans to discover artists, purchase "stakes" in their careers, and track performance of their music investments.

Our work included:
- Complete brand system with logo, color palette, typography, and iconography
- Responsive UI kit with components supporting web and mobile interfaces
- User flow design for artist onboarding, fan investment, and royalty distribution
- Interactive prototypes for user testing and investor presentations
- Integration guidelines for streaming platforms and payment processors

The design balances the excitement of music discovery with the clarity needed for financial transactions, making complex tokenomics accessible to mainstream music fans.

## Results

- **45 artists** onboarded during beta phase
- **$1.2M** in fan investments processed
- **8.5/10** average user satisfaction score
- Featured in Billboard, Rolling Stone, and TechCrunch
